# Detection-and-Analysis-of-Mental-Health-Treatment-at-Workplace

Mental health is a severe issue nowadays affecting thousands of people around the globe. 
Amongst this, mental health in the workplace is an increasingly critical concern, affecting the 
productivity and well-being of an employee. This study aims to develop mechanisms to detect the requirement 
of mental health treatment of workers. Ten machine learning models were trained and tested to 
precisely curate a model which helps predict the necessity of mental health treatment required by 
workers in the workplace. The results exhibited that Random Forest Classifier achieved a perfect 
accuracy of 100% and outperformed all the other classification models, proving its effectiveness. 
Hyperparameter optimizers were employed to improve the predictability, while, LIME and SHAP, 
two explainable AI framework techniques were applied to interpret and retrace the prediction 
output of the machine learning models. Finally, the best model was deployed in a user-friendly 
web application developed using the Flask framework of Python, which allowed users accessing 
the website to get their prediction results easily. The experimental results illustrated that it is 
possible to detect whether an individual requires treatment or not for mental health in the 
workplace with high reliability.
